Spells:
--------------------------------------------
Q: Arctic Burn            Active            Gives flying movement and +400 night vision, increases attack range to 775/850/925/1000, 
                                            projectile speed to 1200, and reduces attack point to 0.1 Each attack adds an instance 
                                            of Arctic Burn. Arctic burn adds 7%/8%/9%/10% of the targets current hp as magic damage.

                          Arctic Flight     Winter Wyvern gains 10% movement speed while soaring through the skies.
			  
                          AGHS              Aghs makes Arctic Burn flight toggleable on / off, while active it adds a constant mana 
                                            cost of 40/35/30/25 mana per second. Aghs also adds 1% of targets Max HP as aditional 
                                            damage to Arctic burn DoT. (this enables the dot to kill since the standard % of current 
                                            hp never will)


W: Splinter Blast         Active            Launches a tracking projectile of ice towards an enemy. The ice shatters on impact, 
                                            leaving the primary target completely unaffected, while hurling damaging splinters into 
                                            nearby enemies in a 500/625/750/875 radius. Enemies struck by the splinters take 
                                            150/300/450/650 damage and are slowed by 40%.

                          Heart of Ice      Winter Wyvern siphons the life force from the heart of her enemies. Each enemy hit by 
                                            Splinter Blast reduces the cooldown timer of Winter's Curse by 1s (0.25s when hitting creeps or 
                                            illusions).

                          Chain Reaction	Splinter Blast triggers a second volley uppon impact with 50% reduced aoe, dealing 75% reduced damage.


E: Cold Embrace           Active            Encases an ally in an icy cocoon, freezing them solid while healing a base amount 
                                            (20/30/40/50) as well as a percentage (3%/5%/7%/9%) of their maximum health each second. 
                                            The cocoon blocks all physical damage.

                          Icy Overload      If the icy coccon suffers (100%/85%/65%/55%) of the targets MAX_HP as physical damage 
                                            it will explode instantly healing the encased target to full.
                        
                          Protective Shell  The icy cocoon is protected by cold magic. Any physical attacker will be frozen for 1.5s 
                                            during Icy Overload.



R: Winter's Curse         Active            Winter Wyvern freezes an enemy in place while striking those nearby with a maddening 
                                            curse which causes them to attack their frozen ally with increased attack speed. The 
                                            frozen ally and those cursed to attack their ally take 100%/75%/50% reduced damage take 
                                            from their enemies. 

                          Queen's Resolve   Winter's Curse ignores tenacity. (rebalanced the curse duration to take this into account)
